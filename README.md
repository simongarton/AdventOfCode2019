# Advent Of Code 2019

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) : a yearly programming competition.

## Day 6
Neat. Building graphs from orbit data. I borrow GraphViz as usual to dump 
out the output into images so I can see what is going on. The first part is a huge
graph, but not particularly complex to build, though you do have to calculate
direct and indirect orbits; the second required Djikstra to find shortest path.

## Day 5 
More IntCode computer stuff.

## Day 4
Password combinations.

## Day 3
Calculation of distances on a grid with wires. Rather neat.

## Day 2
IntCode computer : a list of instructions and they control how to jump back and forth.
Will come back again later.

## Day 1
A slightly recursive calculation where you need to add fuel to get the rocket to take off, 
but then need to add more fuel as by adding fuel the mass of the rocket increased.
